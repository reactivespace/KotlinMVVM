<h1>Open Android-App</h1>
<p>According to the Verge, there have been 2.5 Billion Android Devices at the start of 2020 and this number is only going to increase. With Android devices dominating 70% of the market share right now and predictive forecasting calculating its market share to go up to 80% in 2022, itâ€™s clear that Android Apps will also continue to become more and more popular especially if designed on current trends for the enthusiasts. With such a high target market to pitch apps to but a highly demanding user base monitoring the applications as well as tough competition from a multitude of brands, there are certain practices that one has to follow to be successful in this market. Keeping the users and their behaviors in mind, the developed app must consider Functionality, Scalability and User Experience to reach that level. 


	
In my opinion, the first thing to ponder upon before getting into App Development is the framework and Kotlin stands out above all the others. Gaining popularity after google recommended it in 2017, Kotlin is designed to be fully interloped with Java and its type interface allows its system to be more concise. Used for statically typed programming, it was initially designed for Java Virtual Machine and Android, since it can combine object oriented and functional programming features. Kotlin is famous however for its focus on Interoperability, Null Safety, Smart inference and having developers code twice as fast. The current version of Kotlin being used at the time of writing is 1.4.20.
	The architecture of the app should preferably be MVM (Model View Management) or MVI (Model View Intent). MVI also known as Redux is one of the newest trends in View Architecture practices since it is great for Android Development. This architecture allows the developer to look at all the user interactions and possible states of view that can be highly beneficial when planning the look and feel of the project. The separation in between steps allows easy testing and adding new functionalities is excessively simple. The MVI view state can also be easily plugged in. MVI is most popular as Database and User Interface for interactions can be managed better.
	Caching feature should be included in the app since it allows for better API calls. If a user has any question on the app that needs to be brought from the server or the internet, old information can be highly useful since it will bring data faster completing the query.
	Inputting Pagination functionality in the app is not only considered as a better practice than the traditional previous next navigation but is also quicker and more convenient for the usability of the application. It is dubbed more useful when integrated in the latest android applications.
	The Bottom Navigation Bar is an important material component that makes it easy to explore and switch between the top-level view in a single tap. With the functionality to be taken directly to the associated view or refreshing the currently active view, Bottom Navigation comes in really handy in App Development.
	Applying the ability to back stack in the app makes for better user experience since the data is saved allowing individuals to manage their actions and complete tasks better. Activities that are no longer central can be finished and popped off the stack simply by pressing the back button.
	 



	
Room Database or Local DB is now considered as a better approach for data persistence than the traditional SQLite DB. It makes easier to work with objects in your app, reducing the volume of boilerplate code and confirming SQL queries when finalizing the action. It is also useful when storing data is key during offline activity.


 

All of the practices mentioned above allow for writing clean and maintainable code. Even though there can be other practices that can be followed and might be better in your opinion, it must be remembered that the end goal is to ensure great Android app usability and with the highly competitive market out in the field, new methods and techniques must be used to ensure the app stands out.</p>
